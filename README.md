WRAPPER FOLDER AND CODE::BLOCKS PROJECT FOR CPPUTEST

The Code::Blocks project CppUTest.cbp can be used to compile cpputest.

Putting it into a wrapper folder prevents this getting mixed up with CppUTest 
files when creating pull requests.

The clone of CppUTest should be inside the folder:

    ./cpputest
    
You can name the wrapper folder anything you like.

No guarantee for usefulness or anything.
